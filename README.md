This project is my first Odin Project. 
It's will gather all the knowledge I acquired until now. 
It will test me and put in practice what I've learned. 

After completion I should be able to : 
- Create an HTML page of a website 
- Use the basics and different syntax for writing an HTML page
- Create and edit depository and file 
- Use the basic prompts in PowerShell
- Use Git to write good commits
